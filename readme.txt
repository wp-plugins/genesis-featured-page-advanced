An advanced version of the Genesis - Featured Page widget. Allows you to add a custom image, custom content, page excerpt, and more.

== Description ==

**Please Note:** This plugin is only for Genesis Framework users. Genesis is a premium product by [StudioPress](http://www.studiopress.com).

That said, most Genesis users have probably stumbled upon the *Genesis - Featured Page* widget as a great way to add page teasers/links to your homepage, footer, sidebars, or really any widget area.

However, sometimes you need additional functionality that is not offered in the core widget, such as adding a custom image or custom content. This is what *Genesis - Featured Page Advanced* does.  

= Plugin Highlights =
* Adds intuitive custom image upload field 
* Adds custom content field
* Adds option to display the page excerpt
* Adds the option to remove the page link from the Page Title
* Adds the option to add the page link to the Widget Title
* Adds the option to remove the page link from the image
* Add custom image using media uploader that actually works with widgets (no typing of urls)
* Fields show/hide based on user selection for cleaner UI 
* Works alongside the original *Genesis - Featured Page* widget and other third party widgets
* Uses the same CSS classes as the original Genesis widget, so any styling you are currently using will be passed to this widget
* Genesis 2.0 and HTML5 compatible 

= To Do =
* Internationalization
* Add more features as needed or requested.

**Disclaimer:** This plugin is essentially a forked version of the original *Genesis - Featured Page* widget. Props go to StudioPress for developing the widget, I just modified/enhanced it. 


== Installation ==

1. You have a couple options:
	* *Go to Plugins->Add New and search for "Genesis Featured Page Advanced". Once found, click "Install".
	* *Download the folder from Wordpress.org and zip the folder. Then upload via Plugins->Add New->Upload.

**Please Note:** This plugin is only for Genesis Framework users. Genesis is a premium product by [StudioPress](http://www.studiopress.com). If you do not have Genesis 2.0+ or Wordpress 3.6+, the plugin will not activate.
